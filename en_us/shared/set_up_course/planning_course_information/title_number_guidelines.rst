    .. _Enrollment Track Guidelines:

    ***************************
    Enrollment Track Guidelines
    ***************************

    The enrollment track specifies the certificate type, if any, that is
    available for the course, as well as whether the course has a fee. All
    enrollment tracks other than the audit enrollment track have a fee.

    The edX platform offers the following enrollment tracks.

    * audit
    * credit
    * professional
    * verified

    For more information about each enrollment track, see :ref:`enrollment
    track<enrollment_track_g>`.

    .. note::
      For courses that offer a verified enrollment track, by default, the
      deadline for learners to upgrade to the verified track is 10 days before
      the course end date. The deadline for learners in the verified track to
      submit ID verification is the course end date. To request different
      deadlines, contact your edX project coordinator (PC).

    For information about how to specify an enrollment track, see :ref:`Pub
